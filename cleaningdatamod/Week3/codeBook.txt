This document details the key data frames created in run_analysis.R
as well as the naming convention applied to the final output data
file 'tidyData.txt'

Key Data Frames:

MergeData = The raw merged data for the test and train datasets i.e. 
	    X_test.txt, subject_test.txt,y_test.txt, X_train.txt,
	    subject_train and y_train.txt. Also contains a column of the
	    activity labels e.g. WALKING, LAYING etc... This data frame
 	    has a header, but in its 'raw' state - i.e. not tidied. 
	    A total of 564 columns

MeanStd   = A table extracting the mean and standard deviation columns 
	    from MergeData that contain 'mean()'  and 'std()' patterns.
            Also contains 2 extra columns - subject and activity labels.
	    A total of 68 columns. 


tidyDF    = Long and narrow data frame that contains the computed averages
	    of MeanStd grouped by subject and activity label. When the code
	    completes, it writes this table to a file called 'tidyData.txt'.


Naming Convention For Header:

The naming conventions are based on those found in features_info.txt file which states:
%%%%%%%%
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 


Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

In both MeanStd and tidyDF we have applied the following formatting to column
labels. The features are labelled as follows:


Following the tidy data convention, all column labels have been extended such that 
t = time
f = frequency
acc = accelerometer
gyro = gyroscope
std  = standarddeviation

as well as characters/spaces removed and text foreced to lower case.

so for example: 

 “tBodyAcc-std-XYZ” is now “timebodyaccelerometerstandarddeviationxyz”
